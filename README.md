Use your `wasd` keys to move the snake around the board.
(`,aoe` works too for Dvorak peeps üòâ)

üçé Your aim is to eat the ~~apples~~ assortment of food. As you eat the food, your body grows bigger. Don't run into yourself or the walls, or it's game over.

## To Start the Game

In terminal ‚ñ∂Ô∏è `ruby main.rb`

You will need a terminal with emoji support.

### To Do

- Get the emojis working in a normal terminal (currently works in vs code?) - maybe by incorporating a gem, or by having a unicode only version?
- Snake keeps moving in the direction you tell it to (not waiting for key press)
- User can choose easy, medium or hard, will change the speed of the game.
- Need to make it game over if you collide with yourself or the wall
- When emoji is working more places, I will replace the walls with emoji. The game must go full emoji.
